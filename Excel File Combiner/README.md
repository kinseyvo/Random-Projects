# Excel File Combiner
- Takes any or "n" number of excel files

# How to Use:
- Enter arguments into terminal as:<br />
```python excel_combiner.py file1.xlsx file2.xlsx fileN.xlsx -o output.xlsx```

## Fun Fact:
- I once did this by hand (manually checked each excel back and forth) and didn't realize at the end that I could've automated the process...
